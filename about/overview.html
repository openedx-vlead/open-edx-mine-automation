  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>This course introduces the virtual laboratory on Mine Ventilation. It teaches us to calibrate the inclined tube manometer using Askania Manometer and differential pressure cal, estimation of psychrometric properties and use of psychrometry, change in Wet Kata Cooling Power (WKCP) with changes in velocity, the drag loss due to obstruction, shock loss due to bands or tubs, the frictional co-efficient of mine airways, velocity profile of air flow in a ventilation duct and estimation of average velocity of air from the different point measurements in a cross-section. and many other such exciting experiments.</p>

  <p>This course is a combination of Virtual Lab and NPTEL lectures</p>
